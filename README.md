# compYOUter

Welcome to the compYOUter ReadMe!

## [Background & Overview](https://github.com/OcramT/compYOUter/wiki/Background-&-Overview)

   * CompYOUter will be a simple, interactive game exploring the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). The user will utilize their webcam to play a basic yet fun game with their hands/bodies.

## [Functionality & MVP List](https://github.com/OcramT/compYOUter/wiki/MVP-List)

### In compYOUter, users will be able to:

   * Use their webcam to engage with the application
   * Use their hands and/or body as controls to play a game

### Game & Game Rules(subject to change):

   * Theme will be a play on attack of the 50-ft woman movie
   * Retro vibes/styling
   * Simple, 2d objects (planes, missiles) will scroll across the screen
   * Objects will enter at random heights from either the left or right
   * The player's job will be to dodge each object by ducking
   * *Potential Bonus Game Rules/Features*
      * Certain objects will need to be batted away with the player's hands (bombs)
      * Increasing the speed of objects as time progresses
      * Tracking the user's score

### This project will include:

   * Very basic graphics (I would love to incorporate rudimentary 3D graphics with three.js if I have time)
   * A soundtrack and sound effects

## [Architecture & Technology](https://github.com/OcramT/compYOUter/wiki/Architecture-&-Technology)

This app will likely use the following architecture and technologies:

### Tensorflow.js
   * Tensorflow is an open-source library that allows developers to define and run machine learning models in the browser with Javascript. 

### Posenet Library
   * Posenet is a library that works in conjunction with Tensorflow. It allows for position detection by running real-time pose estimation in the browser.

### Sass
   * Sass will be used for basic splash page styling.

### Canvas
   * Canvas may be required for proper rendering of camera tracking in the browser.
   
## [Implementation Timeline](https://github.com/OcramT/compYOUter/wiki/Implementation-Timeline)
  1. Learn & incorporate basic Posenet functionality
  2. Register user movements in web-camera in real-time
  3. Design game objects
  4. Implement collision detection
  5. Include final styling

## [Bonus Features](https://github.com/OcramT/compYOUter/wiki/Bonus-Features)

### Three.js
   * The inclusion of 3D objects/graphics would be a bonus I'd love to include if I have the time.
